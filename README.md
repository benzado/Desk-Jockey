On October 8, 2008 I gave a presentation at the [New York City iPhone Developer Meetup][1] on using Core Animation to design games. Specifically, the talk was focused on creating a scene using CALayer and then responding to touch events so that certain layers can be dragged around the screen.

In my presentation I make reference to [Apple's GeekGameBoard sample][2]. Jens Alfke has posted [an iPhone version][3] on his blog.
